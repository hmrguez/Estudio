# Study

A guide with all possible algorithms to study for a freshman year CS final exam

Covers all, from iterative programming, to backtracking to working with trees.

Inside each folder you can find basic algorithms for each section along with a few solved exercises. For example:

- Backtracking
  - Permutations
  - Combinations
  - Variations with and without repetition
  - The N-Queens Problem
  - Shortest path to get out of a maze
- Working with Trees
  - Height and breadth of a tree
  - Lowest Common Ancestor Problem
  - Ways to traverse a tree: PreOrder, InOrder, PostOrder
  - Building a Binary Search Tree
  - Changing a whole Tree
  - A Tree based mock of a File System
- Iterative Programming
  - Lee Algorithm for solving mazes

> Everything is contained inside the Library Folder which is a class library, inside their respective folder. The App folder is merely for testing.
